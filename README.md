# Pollinator
## Goal
- The goal of the pollinator is to pollinate the flowers in a precise and optimized manner. 

## Ideation
- Fine-tuned a YOLOv8 model using a [dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/pollinator-2wbdx/pollinator-rjhfp/2) from roboflow to detect tomato flowers
- Captutured images of the flowers from multiple angles using a D435i camera using the [pyrealsense2](https://pypi.org/project/pyrealsense2/) library
- Created a point cloud of the flowers using the camera's intrinsics
- Used a clustering algorithm to identify the flowers in the point cloud
- Found an optimal path to pollinate the flowers using the nearest neighbor algorithm and 2-opt algorithm
- Created a travel path for the pollinator to follow using the optimal path
- Used the [ur_rtde](https://sdurobotics.gitlab.io/ur_rtde/api/api.html) library to travel to the flowers and pollinated them with the robot's end effector

## Running the Pollinator with Python
1. Configure the robotâ€™s network settings by changing the IP address
2. Configure the computer's network setting corresponding to the robot's netwrok 
3. Ensure the required version (3.9.1) of Python is installed
4. Download and extract the ZIP file and run the program

## Features
- Used the process of test, train, valid for training the robot to detect flowers
- Used realsense and opencv to calculate depth of the target flowers
- The robot took multiple pictures in various locations to enhance the accuracy of the detection
- Used vectors and field of view (FOV) of the sensors to calculate offset between the camera, tcp, and the robot base 
- Used clustering algorithm to increase the accuracy of the target flower location
- Used rotations (rx, ry, rz) to optimize pathways between each target flower
